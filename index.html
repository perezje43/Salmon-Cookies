    <img src="family.jpg" id="three"/>
    <p>In 1983, a man named Denny embarked to what is now considered the Pacific Northwest and founded Seattle. He  guided his wayward friends through the Cascades, fighting the elements and disease. They lived in destitute and Denny lost some great men. He made a vow to his new family that their efforts will not be in vain and prosperity is around the next bend. With such optimism, they found their place in Seattle and also discovered Salmon. The bright pink fish was full of nutrients and fats and knew that this fish would be their saivor. One day as he was planning a hiking trip to Mt. Si, he was eating salmon jerky and making cookies at the same time. His dog darted from aonther room and spooked him! He dropped his salmon jerky into the cookie mixed and decided to bake them any way because butter is expensive at Whole foods. The rest is history. </p>
    <p>His original recipe is heavily guarded and used to create each small batch today. Based in Washington, we like to create a quality product using sustainable and local products. These cookies are great source of Omega-3's and protein. These go great with a hike, Starbucks coffees, or while working on code. These cookies are a great healthy snack that kids and dogs will also love.</p>
